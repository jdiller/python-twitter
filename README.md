Python-Twitter Forked from http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/

The way the GetFriends and GetFollowers methods used cursors didn't really work for me (or at all). This fork updates that in a way that suits my purposes, if it suits yours too, I'm glad to have been of service. 

Most credit goes to the original python-twitter dev team for doing all the work,  my changes are minimal.
